# The Challenge

Trine University was looking for a program that would allow them to
streamline their tuition refund payment processes with fewer administrative
resources and to ultimately reduce the costs required to manage and
distribute paper checks.

# The Solution

ICS rapidly implemented a comprehensive, custom solution that quickly
eliminated paper checks and transitioned 100% of the school's tuition-refund
payments to electronic delivery loaded directly to Trine University Prepaid
MasterCard&reg;.

# The Result

ICS helped Trine University to eliminate costs associated with processing and
distributing checks and made its internal operations more streamlined and
efficient, while giving students a faster delivery of tuition refund
disbursements.
