# Streamline delivery of university payments.

ICS provides colleges and universities a convenient way for students to
manage their money and receive tuition refund disbursements.

In addition, our college prepaid card programs are fully integrated with
online financial literacy education and money management tools that help
students learn to manage money, set budgets, refuse credit card offers,
motivate behavior modification and make other responsible financial choices
as they transition through college.
